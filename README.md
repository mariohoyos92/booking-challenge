# Coding Challenge

## Getting Started

First things first, make sure to clone this repository and cd into it, to do this you can run:

`git clone https://github.com/mariohoyos92/booking-challenge`

Make sure that you have node and npm installed on your computer. For instructions on how to do this, please visit [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once you have node installed, make sure that you have created a .env file in the root of this directory with the database credentials filled in. If you don't have a MySQL instance to play around with, you can find one [here](https://remotemysql.com/);

Once you have this all setup, you should be able to run the command:

`npm run demo`

If all goes well, you should see the log "Running on: 3001" unless you changed the port.

Now, you should be able to navigate to localhost:3001 and view/add bookings!

```

```
